Alert provides a cross-platform means of displaying a notification to the user in Julia. It
should work on MacOS, Windows 10 (even under WSL2) and many flavors of Linux. This is handy
for long-running scripts. You can also use an extension
([AlertPushover](https://github.com/haberdashPI/AlertPushover.jl)) to send notifications to
your phone or a webapp when working remotely.

There are three ways to use alert:

1. Call `alert()` after a long-running piece of code.
2. Put long-running code inside the `@alert` macro.
3. Call `alert_REPL!` and any long-running code sent to the REPL will display a notification.

Before using `alert()` at the end of a long-running script, it would be good to
test that it actually works on your system: some linux distros may not have an
appropriate program installed to display the notification. Loading `Alert`
should warn you if it can't find an appropriate executable to send the
notification. Just read the error message that is displayed to see what program
you need to install.

## The `alert()` function

To use `alert()` just add it to some long-running code.

```julia

using Alert

for i in 1:10_000
    long_running_function()
end

alert("Your julia script is finished!")
```

## The `@alert` macro

The `@alert` macro displays a message if the code passed to it runs for longer
than 2 seconds (or a custom value). This is especially handy when using
[`ProgressMeter`](https://github.com/timholy/ProgressMeter.jl), like so.

```julia
@alert @showprogress for i in 1:10_000
    long_running_function()
end
```

## The REPL hook

In Julia 1.5 or greater, if you want any long-running command at the REPL to
send a notification, you can use `alert_REPL!`. It takes the same arguments as
`@alert` and will wrap any code passed to the Julia REPL in a call to `@alert`.

You can add the following to your `startup.jl` file to have it work in every
Julia session.

```julia
try
    using Alert
    alert_REPL!()
catch e
    @warn e.msg
end
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Notification fails to display on Windows**: check to make sure you have Notifications turned on in "Notifications & actions" in your OS settings. ![Window of the Windows 10 "Notifications & actions"](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business5/uploads/julialang/optimized/3X/b/5/b55776f64fa7dae966a3773bca40e3627a1a480b_2_960x750.png)

## Extensions

If you want to use `alert` remotely or in an online IDE, where you can't get local UX
notifications, you can use [AlertPushover](https://github.com/haberdashPI/AlertPushover.jl).
